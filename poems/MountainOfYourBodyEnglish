 > I will merge with you Emerging as Tahmineh from under your loins Not in these sorrowful flatlands But right into the mountain of your body Amidst awe-inspiring rocks and a mouth hiding wolves

 > I will merge with you Making my face bloom fire Not in this silenced middle ground But amid dishevelled clouds Amid strange shapes of memories Amid my craving for your shifting selves

 > I will merge with you I’ll become passion I’ll become feast Filled with light I’ll become drunk Not at the threshold of an open door But within a narrow window Within your crowding presence Within the curse of your silhouette Within that flicker of light left in your arms

 > I will merge with you Become myth Me drunk and you insane I will rise Screaming Shouting Who will lead us home? Pouring from my dress Red white black and a little purple It will be my fate When I merge with you
